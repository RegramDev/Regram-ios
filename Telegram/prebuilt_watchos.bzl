"""Embeds the standalone, xcodebuild-built tgwatch watch app into the Bazel iOS build.

`apple_prebuilt_watchos_application` builds the watch app in two actions and exposes
it through the providers that `ios_application(watch_application = ...)` consumes:

  1. PrebuiltWatchosCompile (prebuilt_watchos_compile.sh) — runs `xcodebuild` against
     the exported tgwatch source tree, baking the api credentials and the bundle id but
     leaving PLACEHOLDER versions, and emits an unsigned .app archive.
  2. PrebuiltWatchosPatchSign (prebuilt_watchos_patch.sh) — rewrites the two per-build
     Info.plist version keys on the compiled app, then optionally codesigns it.

Splitting them lets Bazel cache the expensive (~4-min) compile across build numbers and
version bumps — which is every CI build, since `--define=buildNumber` changes each time.
Only the version is deferred to the patch step: the api id/hash and the bundle id are
stable for a given host configuration, so they stay baked by xcodebuild (the watch
Info.plist derives WKCompanionAppBundleIdentifier from PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER via
$(...:base), so no bundle-id plist mutation is needed). Neither the version nor the api
values reach the compiled binary — they live only in Info.plist — so deferring them
cannot change the compiled output.

The providers exposed:

  * AppleBundleInfo      — bundle metadata (the host reads only `.product_type`).
  * AppleEmbeddableInfo  — `watch_bundles` (the zipped .app placed under Watch/).

The watch source tree is the committed in-repo snapshot at `Telegram/WatchApp/` (tracked
inputs). To update it, re-sync from the standalone tgwatch repo via
`tgwatch/tools/export-sources.sh`.

Notes on the rules_apple providers used here:
  * AppleBundleInfo's public init is banned; we build it with the internal raw
    initializer `new_applebundleinfo` (rules_apple is vendored + pinned in this repo,
    so depending on the internal label is safe).

    # cache: `no-remote-exec` pins execution local while still allowing Bazel to
    # read/write the `--remote_cache` / `--disk_cache`.

    # Note the deliberate absence of `"local": "1"`. Verified against the vendored
    # bazel 8.4.2 via --execution_log_json_file: `local` alone sets cacheable=false and
    # remoteCacheable=false, so it silently defeats every cache — including the disk
    # cache — no matter what the other tags say. `no-remote-exec` + `no-sandbox` already
    # give us local, unsandboxed execution (the log reports remotable=false,
    # runner=local), so `local` would buy nothing and cost all caching. This is the bug
    # that made the original "Enable watch app cache" change inert.
    #
    # Caveat: if the build fleet runs different Xcode major versions, mismatched
    # artifacts could be served (the action key does not include the Xcode version);
