# Patch + sign worker for the apple_prebuilt_watchos_application Bazel rule (action 2 of 2).
#
# Takes the unsigned, placeholder-version watch .app archive produced by
# prebuilt_watchos_compile.sh, rewrites the two per-build Info.plist version keys
# (CFBundleShortVersionString, CFBundleVersion) — neither of which affects the compiled
# binary — then, if a provisioning profile is supplied, codesigns the app and its nested
# frameworks with the watchkitapp provisioning profile and a matching identity, and
# finally zips the .app into the rule's output archive.
#
# Only the version is patched here. The api credentials and the bundle id are baked by
# xcodebuild in the compile action (the Info.plist derives WKCompanionAppBundleIdentifier
# from PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER via $(...:base), so there is no bundle-id plist
# mutation) — they are stable per host configuration, so they can sit in the cacheable
# action. The version is not: it changes on every build, and keeping it out of the
# compile is what lets Bazel reuse the (expensive, ~4-min) xcodebuild result.
#
# The signing inputs — the absolute provisioning-profile path and the keychain identity —
# are machine-specific, which is the other reason this step is a separate action: it is
# marked local + no-remote so its results are never shared across machines.
#
# The host ios_application embeds this archive under Watch/ and re-seals the host;
# it does NOT re-sign the watch app, so the watch signing must happen here.
#
# Args:
#   $1 input_zip     Compiled (unsigned, placeholder-version) .app archive from action 1
#   $2 output_zip    Path (declared by Bazel) to write the final .app archive to
#   $3 identity      Codesigning identity (SHA1 hash); empty => derived from $4's cert
#   $4 profile       Path to the watchkitapp .mobileprovision; empty => unsigned build
#   $5 infoplist_out Path (declared by Bazel) to copy the patched Info.plist to
#   $6 versions_json versions.json (key 'app' => CFBundleShortVersionString)
#   $7 build_number  CFBundleVersion
