        // them ever runs. `installInitialState` seeds it at `attach(to:)` — which happens inside
        // `DocumentCanvasView.init`, before any content exists, so it seeds ZERO.
        // `ensureCanonicalSelectionIsCurrent` and `runMutation` (`+Mutation.swift`) both hang off
        // `prepareAndRun`, and no routed witness calls that: `insertText`, `deleteBackward`,
        // `replace(_:withText:)`, `setMarkedText`/`unmarkText` are all PLAIN D24 forwards to the
        // canvas (that method's own reentry-ledger note says so in as many words). The fourth is
        // `synchronizeAfterExternalChange` itself, which had no production caller at all until this
        // task. So the canvas counter advances on every edit and the backend's stays at 0.
        //
        // MEASURED, not inferred, on a real-backend canvas: after `setParagraphs` + one `insertText` +
        // one `reload`, `canvas.documentRevision` reads 1, 2, 3 while `inputBackend.state
        // .documentRevision` reads 0, 0, 0. With the canvas counter passed as `oldRevision` the
        // continuity guard (`change.oldRevision == documentRevision`) rejects the change, and
        // `RichTextInputContractViolation.report` is an `assertionFailure` in DEBUG: the first probe
        // that ran it produced `Fatal error: … revision continuity violated — change describes
        // oldRevision 1 → newRevision 2, but this backend has adopted 0` and killed the xctest process.
        // In a DEBUG app that is a crash on the first formatting toggle after a keystroke.
        //
        // Reading the backend's baseline is not a way of dodging the guard, it is what continuity
        // MEANS from the backend's side: "you are at X, the document is now at Y — adopt it". Nothing
        // is being misdescribed, because these five sites pass NO `changedRangeBefore`/`After`, so
        // there is no baseline-relative diff for a stale baseline to invalidate — which is the precise
        // hazard the guard's own comment says it exists to catch. And the call is a strict improvement
        // on today: `synchronizeAfterExternalChange` ADOPTS `newRevision`, so each of these sites now
        // drags the backend's cache forward instead of leaving it pinned at 0 forever.
        //
        // **What it costs, stated plainly: at these five call sites the continuity guard can no longer
        // fail.** It still guards every other caller (the fake-client contract suites drive it
        // directly). The honest fix is for the backend to own the mutation path so its counter tracks
        // by construction — Task 41's territory, not a wiring task's.
        //
        // **STOP. THIS BLOCK'S INSTRUCTION WAS DISCHARGED BY TASK 41 AND MUST NOT BE FOLLOWED.**
        // It is preserved rather than deleted because the final branch review found that a stage-2
        // implementer discharging Phase-6 gate item 23 reads it as an outstanding obligation, re-points
        // `oldRevision` at the canvas counter, and ships a DEBUG crash. Task 41 BUILT exactly that fix
        // and MEASURED it: all five `synchronizingExternalChange` sites report `revision continuity
        // violated … has adopted 0`, which is an `assertionFailure` in DEBUG — a crash on the first
        // formatting toggle after a keystroke — **and it does not repair the branch it was meant to
        // repair.** Do not re-derive it; it has been run.
        //
        // WHAT THE TEXT BELOW GOT RIGHT, and it was a real latent bug: with composition state live, a
        // width reflow while composing would rebase from a stale revision and silently drop the marked
        // range. Task 41 reproduced it as a failing test FIRST (`("nil") is not equal to
        // ("Optional({2, 2})")`) and then fixed it — **not** by moving `oldRevision`, but by removing
        // the stale-cache read entirely via `RichTextInputExternalChangeReason.preservesTextOffsets`.
        // The `.layoutOnly` fast path this text cites no longer exists, and `markedRangeStorage` is no
        // longer "dead today" — Task 41 is the commit that made it live.
        //
        // WHAT ACTUALLY REMAINS is narrower and is NOT this line's to fix: the continuity guard is
        // self-satisfying at these five sites while `prepareAndRun` has zero production callers, so it
        // cannot fail by construction. That is **Phase-6 gate item 23**, a stage-2 ENTRY CONDITION,
        // and the item says in terms that stage 1 cannot fail it. Deleting the guard is a permitted
        // answer there — Task 41 removed its second consumer — provided the decision is written down.

        // `synchronizeAfterExternalChange` ends in `publishState(reason: .externalSynchronization)`,

        // that layer — to `canvas.notifyContentSizeChanged()` → `onContentSizeChange` → the facade's
        // `onChange` (a pure relay). That is a NEW host callback this task introduces, at EVERY site,
        // not just the width reflow where a pre-existing test happened to go red. MEASURED, both
        // sides, by `ExternalSynchronizationTests.test_noSiteAddsAHostContentSizeNotification`: at BASE
        // (`7c43541031`'s five source files restored, that test run against them) `reload` notifies the
        // host ONCE, a bold toggle ONCE, a responder undo TWICE and a width reflow NOT AT ALL; before
        // this fix they read 2, 2, 3, 0.
        //
        // **Around the call, not around `body()`, and the difference is a regression in the opposite
        // direction.** Every site's body notifies the host from PRE-EXISTING code — `setBlocks`
        // (`reload`, the undo restore), `editing`'s tail (both formatting sites), `registerUndo`'s own
        // call. Suppressing across the body would DELETE notifications that existed before this task.
        //
        // Saved and restored (under the `defer` below), never reset to `false`, so an outer suppression
        // (`pasteMarkdownTwoStep` step 1 holds one) is never cleared.
        //
        // **The second observable the publish reaches, and it is NOT covered by that flag** (review
        // Minor 3; the review predicted it would disappear here for free — it does not, because
        // `suppressHostChangeNotification` gates `notifyContentSizeChanged` and nothing else).
        // `publishState`'s other half is `presentationClient.apply` → `refreshSelectionUI()` →
        // `inputBackend.checkOnSelectionChange()` → `nativeCheckOnSelectionChange()`, whose
        // `defer { lastCheckedCaret = now }` runs BEFORE its own early-return guard and so re-seeds the
        // counter `setBlocks` deliberately cleared ("a fresh document: nothing checked until the caret
        // traverses it"). `reload` is the only one of the five where that survives — the other four run
        // their own `refreshSelectionUI()` around the bracket, so the counter ends up seeded at BASE
        // too — and there it means the first caret move after a host document set spell-checks a word
        // of a freshly loaded draft the user never traversed, which is the exact case the
        // selection-driven checker exists to avoid. Checkpointed on the same principle as the flag: the
        // sync's publish is a NEW event and must not perturb pre-existing state. Pinned by
        // `test_aReloadStillLeavesNothingCheckedUntilTheCaretTraversesIt` (green at BASE, red without
        // this checkpoint). The rest of `refreshSelectionUI` is idempotent — `updateCaretView`,
        // `updateSelectionHandleViews`, `syncSpoilers` — and is left to run, which is right: the caret
        // and handles do need repositioning against the new content.
        // **The THIRD thing that publish can perturb** (fix round 2, review N3). The same
        // `nativeCheckOnSelectionChange` runs `clearAllCorrectionFlags()` — which strips every
        // `.correction` range from `spellResults` and the alternatives backing them — ALSO before its
        // early-return guard, whenever an autocorrect underline is live in a region other than the
        // caret's. MEASURED, and the reachability is NOT where it was predicted to be: at the two
        // FORMATTING sites there is no delta at all, because `editing`'s own tail already ran the
        // identical code with the identical caret and the identical `spellResults` inside `body()` —
        // the flag is cleared at BASE too. At `reload` and the undo restore `setBlocks` has already
        // emptied `spellResults`, so there is nothing to clear. **`setParagraphsWidthIfNeeded` is the
        // one reachable site**: its body runs no `refreshSelectionUI()` of its own, so at BASE nothing
        // touches the flag and at HEAD the publish silently dropped a live autocorrect underline
        // elsewhere in the document. Pinned by
        // `test_aWidthReflowDoesNotClearAnAutocorrectFlagElsewhere` (green at BASE, red without the
        // checkpoint) and characterised at the formatting sites by its sibling.
        //
        // **All FOUR restores are under ONE `defer`** (fix round 2, review N1). The list has grown one
        // finding at a time — three consecutive reviews asked the same question, *what does
        // `publishState`'s presentation half touch that is not idempotent?* — and nothing here forces a
        // fifth entry if new non-idempotent state lands in that reach. The durable answer is for
        // `.externalSynchronization` not to route into `notifyContentSizeChanged`/`refreshSelectionUI`
        // at all; that is a backend-client change, out of scope for a wiring task. Recorded in the plan
        // against Task 41.
        //
        // **TASK 41 — EXPLICITLY DEFERRED, WITH AN OWNER AND A PRICE, because the plan requires the
        // deferral to be written rather than silent.**
        //
        // OWNER: the stage-2 task that routes mutations through `prepareAndRun`. It inherits this
        // together with the other half of deviation D38 (see this method's `oldRevision` note and
        // `reconcileMarkedTextForExternalChange`'s fast-path note), because both are waiting on the
        // same precondition — the backend owning the mutation path — and splitting them across two
        // commits would leave the backend's cached revision half-live.
        //
        // WHY NOT HERE, measured rather than asserted. Stopping `.externalSynchronization` from
        // reaching `refreshSelectionUI` means reason-gating `publishState`'s PRESENTATION half, not
        // just the lifecycle client's `switch`: `publishState` calls `presentationClient.apply`
        // unconditionally, before the reason is ever consulted. That is a change to what "publish"
        // MEANS, and it is pinned as a pair — `BackendRevisionContractTests
        // .test_layoutOnlyExternalChange_keepsTheDocumentRevision_andPublishesOnce` asserts
        // `presentationApply == 1` AND `lifecyclePublish == 1` for exactly this reason, so the change
        // starts by reddening a contract test that deliberately pins today's answer. Task 41 moves
        // composition state; deciding what a published snapshot delivers to the presentation client is
        // not a decision it is positioned to make well.
        //
        // WHAT TASK 41 CONTRIBUTES INSTEAD — the fifth data point, built rather than predicted. Its
        // one new call into this reach (`registerUndo`'s `clearCompositionState()`,

        //   1. **ARGUED, and sufficient on its own: `setSelection` would GATE the clamp.** Its
        //      `editPolicy.isSelectable` check drops the write entirely, so a non-selectable policy
        //      would leave `anchor`/`head` pointing PAST the new `documentSize`. The clamp is a safety
        //      invariant of the swap, not a user selection attempt; it must not be droppable.
        //      Unobservable today — production runs `.legacyUnrestricted` — which is exactly why no
        //      suite can measure it and why the argument has to carry it.
        //   2. **UNPROVEN — a hypothesis, not a finding. It would trap on a detached backend**
        //      (`guard isAttached` → `assertionFailure` in DEBUG), and `setBlocks` is the document-swap
        //      primitive, reached from `reload`, `registerUndo`'s restore and `spliceFragmentInEditing`
        //      — but **the review built the publishing clamp and measured 0 traps**: no
        //      `detach()`-then-swap probe exists. Class 2 at `applyCaretOutcome` is real; this SITE is
        //      not a demonstrated instance of it. Do not cite it as one.
        //   3. **ARGUED: it would publish inside somebody else's bracket.** Both of the first two
        //      callers run it inside `notifyingContentAndSelectionChange { }`, and the third inside
        //      `editing { }`.
        // **`.range`, NOT `.caret`.** Each endpoint is clamped INDEPENDENTLY and the pair's direction is
        // preserved, exactly as the two raw writes did — a reversed selection stays reversed (`.range`
        // does not normalize). Collapsing this to a caret would silently drop a surviving selection on
        // every document swap; that is axis 2 of the plan's blind-axes block — **and until Task 39 this
        // site had NO pin at all.** Measured: with `.caret(at: min(head, documentSize))` built here, the
        // full `Scripts/iostest.sh` reported **zero failures**. The pin is now
        // `DocumentRevisionTests.test_setBlocks_clampsEachSelectionEndpointIndependently_soASurvivingRangeSurvives`
