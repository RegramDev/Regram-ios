// A chat-specific abstraction of the list-view backend used by ChatHistoryListNodeImpl.

// This is the minimal surface ChatHistoryListNodeImpl actually accesses on its list view — exactly
// the distinct `listView.<member>` accesses in ChatHistoryListNode.swift. It is standalone BY DESIGN:
// it does NOT refine the shared `ListView` protocol even though ~37 members overlap. The duplication
// is intentional (a deliberate design choice) so the chat history surface owns its own contract on
// the path toward an eventual alternative backend.
//

    // Hold the newest-message edge displaced `distance` points beyond where it rests, as if a finger
    // were still holding the overscroll open; `0` releases the hold. Its one caller is the
    // overscroll-action landing in ChatHistoryListNode (`endedInteractiveDragging`), which keeps the
    // "you are all caught up" control on screen for a beat and then ramps the displacement back to
    // zero.
    //
    // This used to be spelled `setTopContentInset(_:)`, and the rename is the fix for a bug the raw
    // spelling caused rather than cosmetics. On `ListViewImpl` that name means `scroller.contentInset`
    // — a SECOND inset, zero at rest and independent of the list's own `insets` — so `set(0.0)` is a
    // restore to neutral. `CoreListChatHistoryBackend` reasonably read it as the list's own top inset
    // and wrote `currentInsets.top`, where `set(0.0)` DESTROYS the real inset (in the rotated chat,
    // the input-panel band; `ChatControllerNode.swift:2510`). Every later content-offset read then
    // reported a permanent fake overscroll, so the overscroll control was rebuilt on every emission
    // and never removed — a dead 94pt band at the bottom of the chat that ate touches until the next
    // layout pass. A member named for the raw mechanism invites each backend to pick its own
    // referent; one named for the intent has a single meaning both can implement.
    //
    // Contract: the hold is a DISPLAY displacement, invisible to the list's own inset accounting.
    // `insets` does not change, and `visibleContentOffset()` keeps reporting against the resting
    // edge — so while held it reads `.known(-distance)`, which is what keeps the control alive and
    // sized. Both backends must preserve that or the control disappears the moment it is held.
    //
    // `movesContent` picks which of the two readings of an edge move the caller wants, and both are
    // needed by the SAME caller at different moments:
    //
    // - `false` (engaging, or handing the edge back) — hold the presented position and let the
    //   overscroll re-measure against the new edge. The finger is holding the content still, or a
    //   spring is in flight that should simply retarget.
    // - `true` (the release ramp) — carry the content with the edge. That is what walks it back down
    //   as the hold closes.
    //
    // Getting this wrong is a teleport by the edge's travel, not a subtle error.
    func holdOverscrollAction(distance: CGFloat, movesContent: Bool)

    // Whether this backend can hold the edge open DURING a drag without moving content. It matters
    // because the physics reads the edge before the host ever hears about the release —
    // `PhysicsScrollEngine.launchFlight` integrates its release hand-off and bakes the whole flight
    // inside the pan's `.ended`, and only then fires `didEndDragging` — so a hold applied at release
    // is always one step late, and out of bounds that step is spring-shaped and proportional to the
    // overscroll. Holding from the moment the control fills gives the gesture ONE edge.
    //
    // False on `ListViewImpl`, deliberately: its lever is `scroller.contentInset`, which UIKit
    // answers by moving `contentOffset`, so it cannot move the edge without moving content — and it
    // needs none of this, since `UIScrollView` owns its own bounce and never reads a stale edge.
    var holdsOverscrollActionDuringDrag: Bool { get }

    // The view the backend's scroll pan gesture recognizer is attached to. NOT `self.view`: only
    // `ListViewImpl` happens to put the pan on its own view, and asking a backend for `.view` and
    // assuming the pan is on it is the bug this member exists to make unrepresentable.
    //
    // Two callers, both of which fail SILENTLY on the wrong view — no build error, no exception,
    // just a gesture that never fires:
    //
    // - `ChatControllerNode`'s previewing-mode `hitTest` force-routes the touch by returning this
    //   view. UIKit binds the touch to the returned view and then collects recognizers from it
    //   UPWARD, so an ancestor of the pan excludes the pan from the touch and previewing mode simply
    //   cannot scroll. (Ordinary scrolling is unaffected either way, because normal hit-testing
    //   descends to a row and the pan host is an ancestor of THAT — which is what makes the wrong
    //   answer look correct in every other mode.)
    // - `addContentGestureRecognizer` and the chat's two-touch selection pan attach here so they
    //   arbitrate against the scroll pan. Arbitration is by same-view enumeration, not by UIKit's
    //   general rules: both backends' `gestureRecognizerShouldBegin` scans
    //   `pan.view.gestureRecognizers` for a `minimumNumberOfTouches == 2` pan to defer to
    //   (`Display/Source/ListViewScroller.swift:22`, and its port in `PhysicsScrollEngine`), so a
    //   recognizer parked on an ancestor is invisible to that scan while still receiving touches.
