    // The insets handed to CoreList: VERTICAL ONLY. Rows are laid out at the full viewport width and
    // the horizontal insets travel to the hosted item as ListViewItemLayoutParams.leftInset/rightInset
    // (CoreListEntryItem.leftInset, CoreListNodeHostView.rebuild) — which is exactly what ListViewImpl
    // does: there is no `x: insets.left` anywhere in ListView.swift, its rows are full width, and the
    // inset reaches the item as a layout param (Display/Source/ListView.swift:2384).
    //
    // Two reasons that level matters, not one:
    //
    //   Orientation.  A node carries its OWN π (ChatMessageItemView.init(rotated:) →
    //                 CATransform3DMakeRotation(π, 0, 0, 1), which flips x as well as y). Item π +
    //                 wrapper π = identity, so an inset applied INSIDE the item lands on the screen
    //                 side the chat named. CoreList's viewport insets instead frame the row itself
    //                 (`contentWidth = width - left - right`, CoreVirtualListView.swift:2262), taking
    //                 only the wrapper's π — so `insets.left` came out on the screen RIGHT. Measured:
    //                 the topics sidebar's 92pt shrank the bubbles by 92pt on the screen RIGHT and
    //                 moved nothing away from the left, so the sidebar overlapped the content it was
    //                 supposed to make room for.
    //
    //   Animation.    Framing the row cannot animate the move, and swapping the insets to fix the
    //                 orientation did not change that. A view's subviews do not follow its
    //                 `bounds.size.width`, so the row's content only moves when the hosted node is
    //                 re-laid out — which happened at the destination width immediately, and mirrored
    //                 that content about a centre that had itself jumped by half the inset. Visually:
    //                 items animating correctly but offset by half the inset from the first frame.
    //                 As a layout param it is an ordinary item relayout, which the item animates on
    //                 the pass transition like any other content change.
    //
    // Vertical needs no such treatment because BOTH backends let the list decide a row's vertical
    // position: one π either way, which the chat's pre-mirror at ChatControllerNode.swift:2500 already
    // accounts for.

    // item how much empty viewport lies beyond it, and the item may move its own content into that
    // space. The three chat items that opt in (`wantsTrailingItemSpaceUpdates`) all do the same thing
    // with it: shift their content container by half the space, which centres the block in the gap.
    // `ChatBotInfoItemNode` and `ChatUserInfoItemNode` set the flag in `init`; a message bubble sets it
    // per-layout, for the centred-link `.messageOptions` preview only.
    //
    // WHICH ITEM. `items.count - 1`, i.e. the OLDEST entry (index 0 is the newest — see
    // `arrivingBlockStableIds`), which the wrapper's π renders at the top of the screen with the free
    // space above it. The offset the item applies is `y: -space/2` in its own coordinates, and its own
    // π composes with the wrapper's to identity, so that reads as "up the screen, into the gap".
    //
    // OFFSET-INDEPENDENT BY CONSTRUCTION, which is the property that makes it safe to call from the
    // scroll path: `settledContentHeight` is an intra-window height and `currentBottomEdgePinSlack` an
    // intra-window span, so a rubber-band overscroll on an underfilled list — the one kind of scrolling
    // that regime allows — cannot make the item drift. `ListViewImpl` computes the same quantity from
    // `visibleAreaHeight - completeHeight` for exactly this reason, rather than from where the last
    // node currently sits.
    //
    // THE PIN TERM. `ListViewImpl` measures the leftover against `effectiveInsets.top`, which
    // `calculatePinToEdgeTopInset` has already widened by the slack an unread separator needs to rest
    // on the far edge. CoreList spends that same slack in its underfill alignment (it places the window
    // on `viewportInsets.top + pinSlack`), so the gap really is smaller by that much and subtracting it
    // is geometry, not bookkeeping. In an underfilled chat the slack always exceeds the leftover — the
    // pin has pushed the oldest content off the far edge, taking the info item with it — so a short
    // chat with an unread separator reports zero and the item stays put. That is `ListViewImpl`'s
    // answer too.
    //
    // Insets come from `currentInsets`, which excludes `overscrollHoldDistance`, matching
    // `ListViewImpl` reading `self.insets` rather than `scroller.contentInset`. CoreList's slack is
    // computed against the held insets and so shrinks by the hold, leaving this up to the hold
    // distance too generous while an overscroll action is live. Unreachable in practice and invisible
    // if reached: it needs an underfilled chat that also has a pinned row, where the leftover is
    // already zero with margin.
    //
    // NOT `updateSizeAndInsets`-gated. The two call sites are the transaction end (where the geometry,
    // the entry set and the loaded window can all have changed) and the scroll callback, which is where
    // `ListViewImpl` reaches `snapToBounds` from as well. A CoreList self-update flush is NOT a third
    // site: `CoreListNodeHostView` declares `onContentDidChange` but never CALLS it — only the demo and
    // test rows do — so a chat row that re-measures itself comes back through `chatHistoryTransaction`
